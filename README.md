# Blockchain Simulation Project

This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of blockchain technology, including block structure, hashing, mining, and consensus mechanisms. It serves as an educational tool to simulate how blockchain ensures data integrity, immutability, and decentralized consensus.

## 1. Blockchain Basics

A blockchain is a decentralized, tamper-resistant digital ledger that stores data in units called blocks, which are cryptographically linked in sequential order. Each block contains a unique hash, a reference to the previous block's hash, a timestamp, and transactional data.

The decentralized architecture ensures transparency and makes it extremely difficult to alter any data once it's been recorded. Modifying any block requires consensus across the network and recalculating all subsequent blocks, providing strong protection against data manipulation.

### Real-World Use Cases

- **Supply Chain Management**  
  Enables real-time tracking and verification of goods throughout the supply chain, improving transparency and reducing fraud.

- **Digital Identity**  
  Allows users to own and manage secure, verifiable digital identities without relying on centralized authorities.

## 2. Block Anatomy

Each block typically contains the following fields:
